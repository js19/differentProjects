# differentProjects


This repository holds code to many different coding challenges that either come from books or websites. I am using one repository for all this code because I thought it would be easier to break challenges down by language and each file is relatively small so opening a new repository for each of these would not be worth it. 

Languages used: C++, Java, Python, Node
